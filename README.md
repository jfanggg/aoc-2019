## About

This repository contains my Advent of Code 2019 code in C++11. 
I mainly did this to practice problem solving and become more familiar with C++.

Solutions here are my own. Most programs run in a few seconds, although a few take up to 3 minutes. 

## Advent of Code

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
