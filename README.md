## About

This repository contains my Advent of Code 2019 code. I mainly did this to practice problem solving and become more familiar with C++.

The solutions here are my own. Most problems run in less than a few seconds, although days 16, 18, and 25 take up to 3 minutes. 

## Advent of Code

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
